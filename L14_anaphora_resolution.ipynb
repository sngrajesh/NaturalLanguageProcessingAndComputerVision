The underlying process of how this is done is yet unclear, especially because it involves a combination of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic factors that are not always explicitly encoded in language. While humans can resolve such references almost instantaneously, machines struggle with anaphora resolution due to the complex interplay of context, world knowledge, and discourse structure. For example, the pronoun \"he\" could theoretically refer to either \"John\" or \"Mary,\" depending on further context or world knowledge, such as prior discourse on their personalities or actions.\n"
