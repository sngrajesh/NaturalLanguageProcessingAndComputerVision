    "$$\\text{Anatomy of Language}$$\n",
    "- Language \n",
    "    - Language is a structured system of communication. The structure of a language is its grammar and the free components are its vocabulary.\n",
    "        - Early Languages\n",
    "        - Modern Linguistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Language as a phenomenon\n",
    "    - Language is considered as a social phenomenon because all human beings communicate with their respective speech communities using the language they speak.\n",
    "        - Spoken Language\n",
    "        - Written Language\n",
    "- Semantics\n",
    "    - Language exists to be meaningful; the study of meaning, both in general theoretical terms and in reference to a specific language, is known as semantics.\n",
    "    - Semantics embraces the meaningful functions of phonological features, such as intonation, and of grammatical structures and the meanings of individual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Language Variants\n",
    "    - Language refers to both the universal human ability to communicate and its specific forms, like English, French, or Swahili.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Physiological and physical basis\n",
    "    - Language originated as a spoken system, evolving naturally with human communication, while writing emerged only 4,000–5,000 years ago as a way to represent speech. For most of human history, language was passed down orally.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Speech Production\n",
    "    - Speaking arises from exhaling air during respiration, modified by vocal tract movements to produce various sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Language Acquisition\n",
    "    - All humans are physiologically alike in speech production. Language is learned from upbringing, not inherited; adopted children acquire their adoptive parents' language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meaning and Style in Language\n",
    "    - Language exists to convey meaning, shaped by the diverse needs of human communication, making the study of meaning highly complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structural, or grammatical, meaning\n",
    "    - Sentence meaning combines word meanings and grammatical structure, as seen in sentences like The dog chased the cat and The boy chased the cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lexical meaning\n",
    "    - Word meaning, or lexical meaning, refers to the individual definitions of words, as outlined in dictionaries. Answering \"What does this word mean?\" is often harder than it seems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Language and culture\n",
    "    - Language is deeply tied to community life and culture, shaping and reflecting the details of daily living universally across all languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transmission of Language and culture\n",
    "    - Language is primarily learned through cultural exposure, with limited direct teaching, as children construct grammar from the speech they hear. Language is an integral part of culture, influencing and reflecting societal membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Symbolic Systems\n",
    "    - Symbolic systems represent the world using meaningful symbols, including human and computer languages.\n",
    "- Types of Languages \n",
    "    - Artificial Language \n",
    "        - Artificial languages arise from simulations, interactions, or experiments, evolving naturally rather than being consciously designed. They are used in cultural evolution studies and psycholinguistic research.\n",
    "    - Constructed Language\n",
    "        - Constructed languages, or conlangs, are intentionally designed for purposes like communication, fiction, experimentation, or art. Examples include international auxiliary languages and fictional languages.\n",
    "    - Logical Language\n",
    "        - Logical languages, such as Loglan and Lojban, use formal logic to eliminate ambiguity, aiming for precision in expression.\n",
    "    - Programming Language\n",
    "        - Programming languages, text-based or graphical, enable writing computer programs. They are defined by syntax and semantics, with some based on specifications (e.g., C) and others by dominant implementations (e.g., Perl).\n",
    "    - Natural Language\n",
    "        - Natural languages evolve naturally through human use and differ from artificial or constructed languages. They are systematic, conventional, redundant, and subject to change over time.\n",
    "        - Natural Imprecision\n",
    "            - Natural language reflects human cognition but includes vague terms like \"tall\" or \"hot,\" challenging precise translation into computational reasoning.\n",
    "- Linguistics\n",
    "    - Linguistics\n",
    "        - inguistics, the science of language, studies human communication, language families, and specific languages, involving subfields like phonetics, syntax, semantics, and sociolinguistics.\n",
    "    - Applied Linguistics\n",
    "        - Applied linguistics applies linguistic research to areas like education, translation, lexicography, language policy, and natural language processing.\n",

    "Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[22][23][24] Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[25] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[26] By at least 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[27][28] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[29] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[30] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[31] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[32] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[33] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[34] but also marked by the declining status of women,[35] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[l][36] The Middle kingdoms exported Sanskrit language, south Indian scripts and religions of Hinduism and Buddhism to the Southeast Asia.\n",
