first this is a bit pricier than the usual store bought but i couldnt resist trying it it definitely has a different spice pop to it it also does not seem to separate as easily as the usual probably wont purchase again,1,1
so delicious i can only buy this every few months so good ill eat it all at once,1,1
i use this soap for my sensitive skin its moisturizing and smells great,1,1
sheamoisture lavender wild orchid oil makes your skin feel so smooth i also like the scent nice and light,1,1
very very strong scenti threw it away i thought since it was supposed to be for sensitive people it wouldnt be scented,0,1
this is officially my favorite brand of oils i have really dry skin and would run through other oils because of having to reapply up to six times a day with this brand i use it after a morning shower and right before bed in a warm bath the smell is amazing and lingers lightly which i love will buy more,1,1
the smell size and lather are perfect,1,1
love the scent and the feeling after every shower,1,1
i bought this soap for my daughter and daughter in law for christmas and they both loved them said it left their skin soft not dry will buy again it doesnt have a lot of odor which is a plus for me,1,1
i love this stuff i tried so many different products toms of maine would not keep mr onion away this product is yummy it keeps the funk back because it stays on it is thicker i no longer have redness under arms either,1,1
